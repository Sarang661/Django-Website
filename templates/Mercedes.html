            The powermill pumping life in the car comes in two variants â€“ Mercedes Benz AMG GT and the Mercedes AMG GT S, which is a more dynamic version runs on a V8 3982cc engine. The V8 3982cc engine is fitted with 2 turbochargers that gulps down a concentrated drink of fuel down its throat and pushes its piston dynamically to generate a maximum power output of 375 kW at 6250 rpm coupled to a maximum torque output of 650Nm between 1750-4750 rpm for the AMG GT S variant.

            The exterior design of the car is something which the designers can surely boast about. The car has an elegantly streamlined body with a low and aerodynamically shaped aqueous design. The attributes like the long, striking and fluidic bonnet design, the expressive three-dimensional one-slat radiator grille, dazzling eye shaped headlamps with LED and daytime running lights, the crowned imposing Mercedes-Benz emblem on the grille and the wide lower air arrests gives the front appearance of the car a ready-to-attack look. The sleek silhouette design of the car incorporates functionality in the for of the side air vents. The particularly aero-foil shape of the car with the precisely curved roof and short rear overhangs describe the knowledge of aerodynamics that is dedicated towards reducing the drag coefficient value to 0.36.

           <b>Wheels</b>

            The sports car explores the roads running on the 19 inch alloy wheels and rear 20 inch wheels for the AMG GT S variant, with tyre dimensions reading 265/35 ZR 19 for front wheels and 295/30 ZR 20 for rear wheels.
               
            <b>Braking and Handling</b>

The furious speeds of the fast sports car are restrained and kept well in controls by the well-calibrated handling assistance added to it. The retardation and handling assistance of the car is a function of the efficient braking system consisting of front and rear vented and cross-drilled discs brakes on front as well as rear wheels with handling assistance provided by the ABS (Antilock Braking System) and EBD (Electronic Brake-Force Distribution). The ultra-responsive car also encloses other handling assistance like the 3-stage Electronic Stability Program, hill start assist, adaptive braking system and Acceleration Skid Control(ASR), which makes the car's handling extremely safe and controllable. The car body is supported upon the double-wishbone type front and rear suspension.
